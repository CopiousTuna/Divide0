========

This game is being developed in Ruby using the Gosu gem.

Currently, balls can be generated randomly using the "R" key and the game can be reset using the "Space" key.
Lines can be generated horizontally or vertically using the left or right mouse buttons, respectively.
As of right now, drawn areas are shaded green when they contain 0 or 1 balls, and all other areas are shaded red.

<b>Requirements:</b>
<ol><li>Ruby 1.9.3+</li>
<li>Gosu (Currently not compatible with Ruby 2.0.0+)</li></ol>

An installer for Ruby can be found at http://rubyinstaller.org/.

To install Gosu, enter "gem install gosu" from a command prompt/terminal/shell linked
with your Ruby installation.
