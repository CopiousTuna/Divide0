========

This game is being developed in Ruby using the Gosu gem.

Currently, balls can be generated randomly using the "R" key and the game can be rest using the "Space" key.
Lines can be generated horizontally or vertically using the left or right mouse buttons, respectively.
As of right now, balls will collide with the boundaries of the window and themselves, but not drawn lines.

The end result will be a game where the player must trap the balls within the lines such that the there
are no other balls within the same "fenced area" as that ball.

<b>Requirements:</b>

<li>Gosu (Currently not compatible with Ruby 2.0.0+)</li></ol>

An installer for Ruby can be found at http://rubyinstaller.org/.

To install Gosu, enter "gem install gosu" from a command prompt/terminal/shell linked
with your Ruby installation.
